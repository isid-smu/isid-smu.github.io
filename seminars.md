Title: On representations of the crystallized algebra C(SU_0(n + 1)).

Abstract: Crystallization C(SU_0(n + 1)) of the family of C*-algebras C(SU_q(n + 1)), 0<q<1 was introduced by Giri and Pal. In a recent paper, they have found
all irreducible representations of C(SU_0(n + 1)) and observed that each of its irreducible representations can be obtained as a norm limit of irreducible representations of C(SU_q(n+1)). Furthermore, they also showed that C(SU_0(n+1)) is a type-1 C*-algebra. In this talk, I will prove that every non-degenerate representation π_0 of C(SU_0(n+1)) on a separable Hilbert space is the norm limit of a q−family of representations π_q of C(SU_q(n + 1)) on the same Hilbert Space. Keeping this as our goal, I will first discuss the Borel structure of the spectrum of C(SU_q(n + 1)), 0 ≤ q < 1. The main result will then be proved by decomposing π_0 into direct integral of irreducible representations.
