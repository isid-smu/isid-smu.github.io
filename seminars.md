Title: **Prediction of network statistics and effects of network sampling**

Speaker: **Anirban Mandal**, ISI Delhi

Date: **August 16, 2023** (Wednesday), 3:30pm - 4:30pm (Seminar Room 2)

**Abstract:** Large networks arise frequently and network sampling
schemes are widely used to observe small sub-parts of such
networks. We explore the effect of such sampling methods in the
context of predicting network summary statistics (for the more
extensive population network). We derive some asymptotic
distributional results under network sampling and explore
distributional properties of selected network summary statistics in
some commonly used network models. We will discuss the challenges in
the estimation of asymptotic bias and variance and also present some
important questions regarding the choice of the proper inferential
framework when network sampling is used. The theoretical results are
supported by a small simulation study.
