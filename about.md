# About Us

The Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) was established by Professor

distributing learned society with the headquarters in Kolkata. Later,
the Institute set up two Centres in Delhi (1974) and Bangalore (1978)
and a branch in Giridih, along with a network of Units of Statistical
Quality Control and Operations Research at Baroda, Mumbai, Pune,
Coimbatore, Chennai, and Hyderabad. The Chennai Unit was upgraded to a
centre in 2006, and a new North-East Centre at Tezpur was started in
2011.
